# Project Description

  This project aims to transform the traditional paper-based rental system into a fully digital system. The goal is to improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility by managing all rental operations electronically.

 The system will allow users to control and monitor rental activities from anywhere, making the process faster, more organized, and more reliable. It will help in managing customers, vehicles, bookings, payments, and records in a secure and centralized platform.
